 <p>An instance of a Windows Console has a screen buffer and an 
     input buffer. It allows console apps to run inside a window or in hardware
       text mode (so as to occupy the entire screen). ...

    <p>A console is the combination of a monitor and keyboard. It is a rudimentary
         interface in which the monitor provides the output and the keyboard is
          used for input. ... Modern consoles often provide a graphical 
          interface that can be used to control machines on a local network 
          (LAN) or provide remote access to remote systems.
